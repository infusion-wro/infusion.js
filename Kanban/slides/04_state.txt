o component can be stateful or stateless
o State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.
o a feature available only to classes component
o initial state in constructor
o read with this.state
o update with this.setState() -> re-render component automatically
o state updates are merged

o Important: state updates may be asynchronous
  - when the new state relies from the last state, should we use setState that accepts a function rather than an object:
  this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
    counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
  }));
