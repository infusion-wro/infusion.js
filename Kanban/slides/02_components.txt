o Component - heart of React philosophy
o Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation

o Functional component:

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

// Hint: don't use this.props in functional component

// Important: Props are Read-Only!!

o Class component
  - extends React.Component
  - has state (private and fully controlled by the component)
  - lifecycle methods

o Both has props, and both can validate props
