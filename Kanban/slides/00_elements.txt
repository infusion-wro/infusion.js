o React -> view
o UI builded from elements
o Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps
o React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create
o React elements are immutable
o An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time
o React only updates what's necessary
